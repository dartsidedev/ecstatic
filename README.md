# `ecstatic`

This package provides API parity with several classes of the Dart SDK
but using instance properties rather than static properties.

This difference enables the use of these APIs in tests, where you can provide
mock implementations.

Many of these classes are taken from the Flutter and Dart codebases.

## `Platform`

* from `flutter_tools/lib/src/base/platform.dart`
